# Remote-IO
RemoteIO is an open-source framework for remote I/O control and simulation, designed to streamline the development and testing of microcontroller-based systems. It enables teams to connect to a remote testbench, leveraging a host controller (like Raspberry Pi) to manage hardware interactions with an Arduino or other microcontrollers.
