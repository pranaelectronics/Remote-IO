# Remote I/O
Remote I/O is an open-source framework for remote I/O control and simulation, designed to streamline the development and testing of microcontroller-based systems. It enables teams to connect to a remote testbench, leveraging a host controller (like Raspberry Pi) to manage hardware interactions with an Arduino or other microcontrollers. Through RemoteIO, developers can simulate sensors, actuators, and other peripherals, facilitating seamless integration and real-time testing from any location.

# Features:
- Remote I/O Control: Manage and test your microcontrollerâ€™s inputs and outputs from anywhere.
- Simulation Environment: Create virtual models of sensors and actuators to test your embedded code.
- Raspberry Pi Integration: Utilize Raspberry Pi GPIOs to interact directly with your microcontroller under test.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Run the simulation panel on any major operating system.
- Open Source: Fully customizable and community-driven, with contributions welcome.
  
Remote I/O simplifies the testing process for distributed teams, enabling faster development cycles and more reliable code for embedded systems.
